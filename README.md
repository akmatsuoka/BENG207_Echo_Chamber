## Background and Significance

### From Vertical Transmission to Lateral Trapping

The BENG207_1 acoustic transfer-matrix model established the frequency-dependent transmission coefficient T(ω) through the vertical multilayer stack (LiNbO₃ – couplant – glass – water) and characterized how couplant degradation affects acoustic coupling efficiency. That model describes how energy enters the fluid channel from below. However, the functional acoustic field that performs the biological work — trapping single-suspended iPSCs and assembling them into 3D spheroids and organoids — propagates **laterally**, parallel to the glass surface, not vertically through the stack (I originally completely got this wrong, so if there is any inconsntency, let me know. I tried to fix everything though).

In our third-generation biohybrid cochlear implant design, SAWs generated by the LiNbO₃ transducer couple into the fluid channel and establish a lateral standing wave between the rigid sidewalls of the microchannel. The vertical stack (LiNbO₃ → US gel couplant → glass) serves as the energy delivery pathway, while the lateral standing wave between the channel sidewalls is the field that actually traps and organizes cells. The BENG207_1 model addresses the former; this model addresses the latter.

### Organoid Spacing Rationale: Matching Cochlear Implant Geometry

The human cochlea is approximately 30 mm in length, and a standard cochlear implant (CI) electrode array contains 22 channels (electrodes) distributed along this length. This gives an inter-electrode spacing of roughly 30/22 ≈ 1.36 mm. For the biohybrid CI to function, each organoid must interface with one CI electrode, meaning the organoid-to-organoid spacing must match the electrode-to-electrode spacing. We therefore target an organoid spacing of approximately **1 mm** (center-to-center), which is a conservative round number within the physiologically relevant range of 1–1.5 mm.

This spacing constraint directly determines the operating frequency. In a lateral standing wave, particles collect at pressure nodes spaced at $\lambda$/2. Setting $\lambda$/2 = 1 mm gives:

f = c_f / (2 × 1 mm) = 1483 / (2 × 0.001) ≈ **741 kHz**

This is consistent with the ~800 kHz operating frequency that Alexi has indicated for our experimental setup (Anna, you probably want to talk to Alexi to get this frequency consistent). At this frequency, the acoustic wavelength in water is $\lambda$ ≈ 2 mm, and a 1 mm spacing places one organoid per half-wavelength — each sitting in a pressure node with a trapping potential well roughly 1 mm wide, which comfortably accommodates a 200 µm diameter organoid with ~400 µm of clear space on each side for neurite extension toward neighboring organoids or spiral ganglion neurons.

### Channel Length and Organoid Count

The microchannel lengths under investigation range from 5 mm to 20 mm. At 1 mm node spacing, this accommodates:

* L = 5 mm → n = 5 nodes → 5 organoids
* L = 10 mm → n = 10 nodes → 10 organoids
* L = 15 mm → n = 15 nodes → 15 organoids
* L = 20 mm → n = 20 nodes → 20 organoids

These numbers align well with the 22-channel CI geometry. A 20 mm channel producing 20 organoids at 1 mm spacing would span two-thirds of the cochlear length — a realistic target for a first-generation biohybrid device. Shorter channels (5–10 mm) provide a practical test bed for validating the acoustic patterning before scaling to full cochlear length (In my opinion, shorter would yiled better results).

### The Rigid Cavity Resonator Concept

The channel sidewalls (glass or silicon, whichever you guys are using) have acoustic impedances far exceeding that of water. Borosilicate glass gives $Z_{3}$ = 12.58 MRayl versus Z_f = 1.48 MRayl in water, yielding a reflection coefficient:

$$
|r| = \frac{Z_3 - Z_f}{Z_3 + Z_f} \approx 0.79
$$

If silicon sidewalls are used (Z_Si ≈ 19.7 MRayl), then |r| ≈ 0.86. In either case, the reflection is strong enough to establish a well-defined standing wave. The channel therefore behaves as a **rigid cavity resonator** — an acoustic volume bounded on both lateral ends by high-impedance walls.

The resonant modes of the cavity occur at frequencies satisfying L = n $\lambda$/2, or equivalently:

$$
f_n = \frac{n\,c_f}{2L}
$$

where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the mode number. Each mode produces n pressure nodes, evenly spaced at intervals of L/n. For organoid formation, we select the mode number n such that L/n ≈ 1 mm.

The key advantage of operating at low mode numbers (n = 5–20) compared to our earlier estimate (n = 25–100 at 200 µm spacing) is that the resonances are broader, the Q-factor is lower, frequency tolerance is more forgiving, and nodal uniformity across the channel is better. This makes the system substantially easier to drive and more robust to manufacturing variations.

### Quality Factor and Nodal Uniformity

The quality factor Q of the cavity determines how sharply each resonance peaks and how tolerant the system is to frequency detuning. For a cavity with wall reflection coefficient |r| and fluid attenuation α:

$$
Q \approx \frac{\pi n}{1 - |r|^2 + 2\alpha L}
$$

At mode numbers n = 5–20, Q is moderate (on the order of 10–50), meaning the resonances have a useful bandwidth of tens of kHz. This is experimentally favorable — the driving frequency does not need to be controlled to sub-kHz precision.

Nodal uniformity — whether all nodes across the channel length have the same pressure amplitude — is critical for producing organoids of uniform size. Two mechanisms degrade uniformity. First, fluid attenuation α causes the standing wave amplitude to decay from the excitation point toward the center of the cavity. At 741 kHz in water, α is very small (~0.0001 Np/m, scaling as f²), so attenuation is negligible even for 20 mm channels. Second, imperfect reflection (|r| < 1) means the reflected wave is weaker than the forward wave, creating an asymmetric pressure envelope. The standing wave ratio S = |r| · exp(−2αL) quantifies this asymmetry. For |r| = 0.79 (glass) and L = 20 mm at 741 kHz, S ≈ 0.79, giving a contrast ratio C = ((1+S)/(1−S))² ≈ 58 (17.6 dB). Using silicon sidewalls (|r| = 0.86) improves this to C ≈ 107 (20.3 dB).

At the lower operating frequency (~741 kHz vs. 20 MHz), the attenuation per unit length is roughly (0.741/20)² ≈ 1/730 times smaller than at 20 MHz. This means attenuation is essentially irrelevant for our channel lengths, and the dominant factor limiting standing wave quality is the wall reflection coefficient |r|.

### Relationship to the Transfer-Matrix Model (AKA BENG207_Multilayer Model)

The rigid cavity resonator model and the BENG207_1 transfer-matrix model describe orthogonal aspects of the same device. The transfer-matrix model determines how efficiently the transducer drives acoustic energy through the vertical stack and into the fluid channel — this sets the absolute pressure amplitude p₀ available for lateral trapping. The cavity resonator model then determines how that energy is spatially organized laterally between the sidewalls — this sets the nodal pattern, contrast, and uniformity.

The two models are coupled through p₀: the acoustic pressure available for the lateral standing wave is the transmitted pressure from the vertical stack. If couplant degradation reduces T(ω) by 3 dB (as predicted by the transfer-matrix model under gel aging), the radiation force at every node drops by 50%, which may be insufficient to hold organoids against convective disturbances in the channel. Note that the transfer-matrix model parameters (particularly the couplant layer properties) should be re-evaluated at ~741 kHz rather than 20 MHz, as the frequency-dependent behavior of the Kelvin-Voigt couplant differs substantially at these two frequencies.

### Experimental Validation

The key predictions of the rigid cavity resonator model are directly testable:

* **Mode number verification:** The number of organoids formed in a channel of known length directly reveals the active mode number n and confirms the effective half-wavelength spacing. A 10 mm channel at 741 kHz should produce exactly 10 organoids at 1 mm spacing.
* **Nodal uniformity:** Imaging the size distribution of organoids along the channel reveals spatial variations in acoustic radiation force. Systematic size gradients (larger near walls, smaller at center, or vice versa) indicate standing wave amplitude non-uniformity.
* **Frequency sensitivity:** Sweeping the driving frequency through a resonance peak and measuring organoid formation quality (number, spacing regularity, size uniformity) maps the effective Q of the cavity.
* **Wall material dependence:** Comparing organoid quality between glass-walled and silicon-walled channels at the same frequency tests the predicted dependence on |r|.
* **Spacing verification:** The center-to-center distance between adjacent organoids should be λ/2 ≈ 1 mm. Deviations indicate either frequency error, non-uniform channel geometry, or temperature-dependent sound speed changes.

### Gor'kov Acoustic Radiation Force: From Pressure Gradient to Physical Force

The original version of this model computed radiation force as proportional to −∂/∂x⟨p²⟩, which is dimensionless (or rather, in units of Pa²/m when the pressure field is normalized to p₀ = 1 Pa). This is sufficient for predicting *where* organoids form (pressure nodes) and comparing *relative* force between nodes (uniformity), but it does not tell you *how hard* the acoustic field is actually pulling on a cell and therefore somewhat unrelistic in nature. 

To get force in physical units (Newtons), we need the Gor'kov potential formalism. IF you want to read upon it, please see For a small compressible sphere of radius $a$ in a standing wave, the time-averaged radiation force is:

$$
F_{\mathrm{rad}} = -\nabla U = \Phi \cdot \frac{\pi a^3}{3 \rho_f c_f^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\langle p^2 \rangle\right)
$$

where $\Phi$ is the **acoustic contrast factor**:

$$
\Phi = \frac{f_1}{3} + \frac{f_2}{2}
$$

with monopole and dipole scattering coefficients:

$$
f_1 = 1 - \frac{\kappa_p}{\kappa_f} = 1 - \frac{\rho_f c_f^2}{\rho_p c_p^2}, \qquad
f_2 = \frac{2(\rho_p - \rho_f)}{2\rho_p + \rho_f}
$$

Here $\kappa_p$ and $\kappa_f$ are the compressibilities of the particle and fluid, respectively; $\rho_p$ and $c_p$ are the density and sound speed of the particle (cell/organoid).

The sign of $\Phi$ determines the trapping behavior:

* **$\Phi$ > 0:** particles migrate to pressure **nodes** (our case — this is what we want)
* **$\Phi$ < 0:** particles migrate to pressure **antinodes** (e.g., lipid droplets, gas bubbles)

#### Beads vs. Cells: Why the Literature Value of Φ ≈ 0.17 Is Wrong for Our System (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!!)

Much of the acoustofluidics literature reports $\Phi$ ≈ 0.17, which comes from polystyrene beads (ρ_p = 1050 kg/m³, c_p = 2350 m/s) — the standard calibration particle for acoustic trapping experiments. This is the value you will find in most review papers and textbook examples. **However, this value does not apply to cells or organoids.**

The critical difference is the sound speed. Polystyrene has c_p = 2350 m/s, which is far above water (c_f = 1483 m/s). This gives a large monopole coefficient f₁ ≈ 0.44 because the compressibility ratio κ_p/κ_f is small — polystyrene is much stiffer than water. Cells, on the other hand, are mostly water with some protein content, giving c_p ≈ 1520–1600 m/s — only slightly above water. This makes f₁ much smaller.

For our iPSC organoids, using representative cell properties (ρ_p ≈ 1050 kg/m³, c_p ≈ 1550 m/s, consistent with Cohen et al., 2020):

* f₁ = 1 − (1000 × 1483²) / (1050 × 1550²) ≈ **0.128** (monopole — compressibility contrast)
* f₂ = 2 × (1050 − 1000) / (2 × 1050 + 1000) ≈ **0.032** (dipole — density contrast)
* **Φ = 0.128/3 + 0.032/2 ≈ 0.059**

Compare with polystyrene beads:

* f₁ = 1 − (1000 × 1483²) / (1050 × 2350²) ≈ 0.62
* f₂ = 0.032 (same density)
* Φ ≈ 0.62/3 + 0.032/2 ≈ 0.22

So **cells have roughly 3× lower acoustic contrast factor than polystyrene beads**. The practical consequence is that the acoustic pressure amplitude p₀ required to trap cells is √3 ≈ 1.7× higher than for beads (since force scales as p₀²), or equivalently the acoustic power must be ~3× higher. This is an important design consideration: demonstrations with beads at low power may not replicate with cells unless the power is increased.

Note that the density contrast (f₂ ≈ 0.032) is the same for both beads and cells since they have similar densities. The entire difference in Φ comes from the monopole (compressibility) term f₁. This means the dominant physical mechanism trapping polystyrene beads is their stiffness relative to water, whereas for cells, the trapping is weaker and comes from a more balanced combination of the (small) stiffness and density contrasts.

Cohen et al. (2020) experimentally confirmed that DRG neurons and PC12 cells are successfully trapped at acoustic pressure nodes using BAW excitation at 1.14 MHz — the same frequency range as our system (~741 kHz). Their success demonstrates that the lower Φ for biological cells is still sufficient for stable trapping, provided adequate acoustic pressure is supplied.

The Gor'kov force in the model output (Fig 4) is reported in Newtons assuming p₀ = 1 Pa normalization. To estimate the actual force on a 200 µm diameter organoid at a realistic acoustic pressure (e.g., p₀ = 100 kPa), multiply the reported values by p₀² = 10¹⁰. This gives forces on the order of femtonewtons to piconewtons per organoid, which is consistent with the trapping forces reported in the acoustofluidics literature.

**BENG207 Students: the values ρ_p = 1050 kg/m³ and c_p = 1550 m/s are reasonable defaults but should be updated if direct measurements of organoid acoustic properties become available. The contrast factor is sensitive to c_p — a 5% change in c_p changes Φ by ~20%.**

### Supporting Literature

Two recent papers directly validate the physics of our model at the relevant frequency range (Thanks to Alexi!):

**Wang et al. (2022, Applied Physics Letters)** demonstrated standing wave patterning in a glass cuvette (rigid cavity) at 489 kHz and 734 kHz using a single 500 kHz broadband transducer. Their 10 mm cuvette at mode N = 9 produced node spacing of ~1.1 mm — nearly identical to our 1 mm target. Their resonant mode equation f_N = Nc_f/(2L) is the same as ours. This paper provides direct experimental validation that rigid-wall standing waves at our operating frequency produce well-defined node patterns with millimeter-scale spacing, and that a simple 1-D model accurately predicts node positions. Their sequential mode-switching technique (applying mode N = 6 first, then N = 9) could be relevant if selective node population is ever needed.

**Cohen et al. (2020, Scientific Reports)** used both SAWs and BAWs to pattern neurons (DRG neurons and PC12 cells) into organized clusters on a 3D collagen hydrogel, then demonstrated that neurons spontaneously grew neurites toward adjacent clusters over 2–6 days. Their BAW setup operated at 1.14 MHz (same order as our 741 kHz). This is directly relevant to the biological endpoint of our biohybrid CI: acoustically patterned neural aggregates forming directed inter-cluster connections. Their work confirms that (a) biological cells have sufficient acoustic contrast for stable trapping at sub-MHz to low-MHz frequencies despite Φ being lower than for polystyrene beads, and (b) acoustically positioned neurons produce directed neurite outgrowth governed by chemical cues from neighboring clusters — exactly the organoid-to-SGN connectivity our device requires.

## Deliverable

Here we compute the lateral standing wave pressure field p(x) inside a rigid cavity resonator of length L = 5–20 mm, driven at frequencies near f = c_f/(2 × 1 mm) ≈ 741 kHz. We characterize:

1. The resonant mode structure (f_n, mode spacing, Q-factor) as a function of channel length and wall material.
2. The spatial pressure profile p(x) at resonance, including amplitude non-uniformity due to attenuation and imperfect reflection.
3. The acoustic radiation force at each node, and the predicted organoid count, spacing, and size uniformity.
4. Sensitivity to frequency detuning, wall reflectivity, and channel length tolerance.
5. The coupling layer sub-model (vertical stack transmission into the channel), evaluated at ~741 kHz.

## BENG207 Rigid Cavity Resonator Model (Analytical Model)

### Standing Wave in Lateral Cavity (Part A)

The forward and reflected pressure waves propagate laterally along the channel (x-axis, parallel to the glass surface):

$$
p(x) = p_0 e^{-(\alpha - i k)x} + r\,p_0 e^{-(\alpha - i k)(2L - x)}
$$

where α is the fluid attenuation coefficient (Np/m), k = 2πf/c_f is the wavenumber, L is the channel length (5–20 mm), and r is the complex reflection coefficient at the rigid sidewalls. The cavity resonance condition is:

$$
f_n = \frac{n\,c_f}{2L}, \quad n = 1,2,3,\ldots
$$

The standing wave ratio at position x is S(x) = |r| · exp(−2α(L − x)), and the contrast is C(x) = ((1 + S)/(1 − S))².

The acoustic radiation force on a compressible particle (iPSC) at position x is given by the Gor'kov potential gradient:

$$
F_{\mathrm{rad}}(x) = \Phi \cdot \frac{\pi a^3}{3 \rho_f c_f^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\langle p^2(x)\rangle\right)
$$

where Φ ≈ 0.059 is the acoustic contrast factor for cells in water (see discussion above), and $a$ ≈ 100 µm is the organoid radius. The force drives particles toward pressure nodes (Φ > 0). The Gor'kov prefactor converts the dimensionless pressure gradient into physical force in Newtons. Note that for polystyrene beads (Φ ≈ 0.22), the same pressure field produces ~3× larger trapping force — see the "Beads vs. Cells" discussion above for why literature bead-based demonstrations may require higher acoustic power to replicate with biological cells.

### Coupling Layer Sub-Model (Part B)

The vertical stack (transducer → couplant → glass) determines the pressure amplitude p₀ that enters the channel. This sub-model is carried forward from the echo chamber model, now evaluated at ~741 kHz:

$$
Z_{\mathrm{in}}(d) = Z_2 \,\frac{Z_3 + i Z_2 \tan(k_2 d)}{Z_2 + i Z_3 \tan(k_2 d)}
$$

$$
T_{\mathrm{power}} = 1 - |r_{\mathrm{vert}}|^2, \quad
r_{\mathrm{vert}} = \frac{Z_{\mathrm{in}} - Z_1}{Z_{\mathrm{in}} + Z_1}
$$

At 741 kHz, the couplant wavelength is λ₂ = c₂/f = 1500/741000 ≈ 2.02 mm, so typical couplant thicknesses (5–50 µm) are deep in the sub-wavelength regime (d/λ₂ < 0.025). This means the couplant is nearly transparent at this frequency, and coupling efficiency is much less sensitive to couplant thickness than at 20 MHz.

### Figure

![Rigid Cavity Resonator Schematic](docs/img/BENG207_model_2_schematic.jpg)

Figure 1: Three-dimensional schematic of the rigid cavity resonator. The vertical stack (LiNbO₃ → US gel → glass) is shown at the bottom. The fluid channel sits on top of the glass, bounded laterally by rigid sidewalls. The standing wave (pink) propagates horizontally along the channel length, with pressure nodes spaced at λ/2 ≈ 1 mm. iPSC organoids (~200 µm diameter) form at each pressure node, matching the inter-electrode spacing of a 22-channel cochlear implant. Forward wave (p⁺) enters from the left wall; reflected wave (p⁻) returns from the right wall.
